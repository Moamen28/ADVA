ADVA Test Project
Overview:

This project is designed to create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employees and departments. 
It is a comprehensive implementation that showcases interaction between a backend service and a frontend application.

Key Features:

CRUD Operations: Allows managing employees and departments including creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.

.NET Core Web API: Utilizes the .NET Core framework to build a robust and scalable backend.

SQL Server: Employs SQL Server as the database to store and manage data effectively.

Angular 15: Leverages Angular 15 for crafting a dynamic and responsive frontend.

AutoMapper: Implements AutoMapper for object-to-object mapping, reducing the need for manual mapping and simplifying the codebase.

Entity Framework (EF) Core: Uses EF Core as an object-relational mapper (ORM) to enable .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects.

LINQ: Integrates Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) to enable writing powerful and expressive queries directly in C#.

Custom Middleware for Exception Handling: Incorporates custom middleware to handle exceptions gracefully, providing a better debugging experience and more reliable application.

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs): Utilizes DTOs to transfer data between processes, ensuring that only the necessary data is exposed.

Repository Pattern: Implements the Repository pattern to separate the logic that retrieves data from the database from the business logic.

Unit of Work: Applies the Unit of Work pattern to maintain a list of transactions and coordinate the writing out of changes.

Dependency Injection (DI): Employs DI for resolving dependencies in the application, promoting a modular and decoupled design.
Objective:

The objective of this project is to demonstrate a full-stack application setup with efficient data handling, 
clear separation of concerns, and robust error management, resulting in a maintainable and scalable system.
